        description: >
          We want to help as many organizations as we possibly can. Unfortunately, we cannot take every
          project because of the large amount of resources each one requires. These are the primary criteria
          we use to determine project fit.

      faq:
        q1:
          question: How often do project teams and nonprofits meet?
          answer: >
            The client and the project leader meet on a weekly or biweekly basis to ensure the
            projectâ€™s progress. There are project scoping meetings with the project leader
            at the project start, a formal midpoint presentation, and a final presentation where the project
            is delivered.
        q2:
          question: What is the client-team interaction like?
          answer: >
            The team works alongside the client's vision for the organization. We hope that our project has
            significant impact on the organization's efficiency and reach, so the alignment of goals is
            crucial. At our meetings, we discuss updates on project features, check the timeline, and have
            discussion on the progress of the project and the nonprofit itself.
        q3:
          question: How does Blueprint ensure success?
          answer: >
            Our club recruits the brightest and most hard-working students at UC Berkeley, one of the best
            universities in computer science. Through effective leadership and frequent checkins with our
            clients we hope that the combination of talent, dedication, and care will result in a project that
            benefits your organization.
