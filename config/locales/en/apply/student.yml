      decision_criteria:
        description: >
          If we could, we would accept every applicant but unfortunately we cannot manage the volume
          of people and administrative overhead while still fulfilling our mission to the best of
          our abilities. The following criteria are what we use to evaluate applicants.
      faq:
        q1:
          question: What is Blueprint's project structure?
          answer: >
            Blueprint's project structure consists of 4-5 project teams, each with a project leader and 4
            developers on the team. Each project team is in charge of creating technology resources
            for a specific non-profit they work with.
        q2:
          question: How are client team interactions conducted?
          answer: >
            The client and the project leader communicate on a weekly basis to ensure the
            projectâ€™s progress. Meetings occur throughout the project engagement, beginning with
            at least one mandatory project scoping meeting with the project leader at the onset.
            A formal midpoint presentation will be given in Week 5 of the engagement, and the final
            recommendation will be delivered at a final presentation in Week 10.
        q3:
          question: What resources does Blueprint have to ensure success?
          answer: >
            Our club recruits some of the most hard-working, passionate, and brightest students
            at UC Berkeley, just like you. Through effective leadership, frequent check-ins, and an
            organized project timeline set with our clients, we hope that the combination of talent,
            dedication, and care will result in projects that benefit the non-profits we work with.
