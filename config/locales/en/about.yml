        To make beautiful engineering accessible and useful
        for those who create communities and promote public welfare.
      values:
        craft: >
          Our projects are carefully constructed from the first contact with the nonprofit to project
          deployment and live use. We are meticulous about our design, our process, and our code.
        culture: >
          Bloopers work hard and play hard. When we’re not developing, we eat, play,
          and volunteer together. We value a good sense of humor and think that there's fun to be had
          wherever we go.
        heart: >
          We believe that our education and abilities should be used for good. Our motivation pushes us to
          constantly learn, work hard, and find solutions where others haven't looked.
