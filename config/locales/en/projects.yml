      Re-Plate:
        title: Re-Plate
        short_summary: >
          Re-Plate is a Berkeley nonprofit that aims to use technology to eliminate food
          waste and hunger in the community. They collect surplus food donations from
          businesses and deliver the food to homeless shelters and people in need.

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Re-Plate currently acts as a middleman for all transactions and relies on a
          fleet of drivers to ship food around. As they scale, Re-Plate needs a more direct
          system for donors and recipients to communicate with each other.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint’s team is developing an online marketplace for food donations. This
          system will allow anybody with surplus food — not just businesses — to post a
          donation and for nearby recipients to claim the donation. Re-Plate’s staff would be
          able to facilitate the process and monitor the marketplace. Through this system,
          Re-Plate doesn’t have to manually track each donation, which would allow them to
          scale to cities across the US and potentially feed thousands of additional individuals.

      Lava Mae:
        title: Lava Mae
        short_summary: >

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          In order for Lava Mae to respond to an increasing number of inquiries worldwide about
          starting a similar organization, they require a way to manage the network that can share
          information and connect organizations.

          The Solution
          -----------
          Blueprint's project team will build this capability in a web application to help Lava Mae
          grow and manage this network. It will consist of a discussion forum for people to ask questions
          and give responses, a page for Lava Mae to upload relevant toolkits and resources, and an
          interactive map to showcase their growing network. Through this tool, Lava Mae can connect
          users and continue to scale.

      Roots of Success:

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Many students, including people in correctional facilities and untapped schools,
          do not have the opportunity to access many educational materials and other related
          academic resources.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint’s is partnering with Roots of Success to bring their material onto
          an accessible digital platform. The organization will be able to create online
          modules, consolidating their materials into one central location. This can reach
          students who have traditionally not been included in such education programs, including
          people in correctional facilities and untapped schools. By creating this app, Blueprint
          hopes to ease educational access for students and potentially impact thousands of individuals.

      Data Science:
        title: UC Berkeley Data Science Education Program
        short_summary: >
          The Data Science Education Program is an initiative at UC Berkeley that aims to
          expand data science learning for undergrads, and is designed for
          students from non-technical backgrounds.

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Few other colleges teach data science as an intro course, not because the content is challenging
          so much as because the student set-up time is so high. Many packages and tools — such as Jupyter,
          Pandas, and Matplotlib —need to be configured for students to adequately learn key concepts.
          This presents a serious barrier to entry for non-technical students.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint’s project team will be creating a new deployment system that is easy for other classes
          and universities to use. This new system will deploy in one step with minimal configuration. be
          easily monitored for traffic and errors, and work across multiple cloud providers, including Google
          Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services. Blueprint’s completed application will potentially
          impact thousands of students in Berkeley alone — and if it is used by other universities, countless
          more students will be exposed to the power of data science.
      Forte:
        title: Forte
        short_summary: >
          Forte is a Berkeley nonprofit that strives to make music lessons more affordable for children from
          underserved communities. They match K-12 students with college-age teachers, and offer over 12 instruments.

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          As Forte scales their operations to cater to more students and teachers, they can no longer
          manage to do everything manually, including accepting applications, matching up suitable
          teachers with students, and scheduling individual music lessons.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint’s Forte team will build a web application to help automate a large part of this
          process. This web application will include an application system for interested students and
          teachers, a scheduling dashboard for students and teachers to see upcoming and past lessons,
          and profiles for individual students and teachers. Through this system, Forte will be able to
          handle more demand, ultimately fostering lifelong passions for music.

      bpsf:
        title: Berkeley Public Schools Fund
        short_summary: >
          Provides a way for Berkeley public school teachers to fund classroom projects.
        link: https://schoolsfund-friendsandfamily.herokuapp.com/
        banner_image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/calblueprint-prod/images/bpsf.png
        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Every year, the schools fund would review hundreds of grant applications
          by hand in a very time consuming process. Grants would then only be
          awarded once a year for teachers, even though the teachers needed the
          funds throughout the year.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with the Schools Fund to create Friends and
          Family, a local crowdfunding platform for Berkeley School District
          teachers to utilize. With this new platform, teachers have been able to
          raise almost $30,000 thus far.

      phc:
        title: Project Homeless Connect
        short_summary: >
          Provides a secure way for the homeless to sign up for services and for
          volunteers to collect data.

        banner_image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/calblueprint-prod/images/phc.png
        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Project Homeless Connect runs approximately five events a year where they
          provide the homeless population of San Francisco with services such as
          hair cuts and wheelchair repairs. Every event the clients fill out a paper
          form with their personal information such as their SSN, and carry around a
          carbon copy during the event. This runs the risk of the client losing
          their carbon copy and exposing their personal information, while also
          accruing a large time debt for the organization to copy information from
          the paper form into their Salesforce CRM.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with Project Homeless Connect by developing an
          Android application that allowed clients to check in to the event. The
          application removed the cost of carbon copy paper, while adding the
          security of not carrying their personal information along with them, but
          rather a QR code associated with their information. The Android
          application also entered the data directly to their Salesforce CRM while
          reducing the number of duplicate entries, thus saving them countless hours
          of data entry every event.

      odalc:
        title: Oakland Digital Arts and Literacy
        short_summary: >
          Allows tech and design professionals around the Bay Area to teach courses
          at the Oakland Digital Office.

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          ODALC aims to empower people with digital literacy education that will
          improve their lives and the communities they live in, but struggled with
          how to connect professionals in the tech and design industry with under
          resourced communities.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with ODALC to create a platform that seamlessly
          bridges technology, design and low-income communities. This platform
          serves to empower individuals to harness the digital tools to succeed in
          the 21st century.

      ros:
        title: Roots of Success
        short_summary: >
          Provides a way for Roots of Success teachers to manage various curricula
          and classes.
        link: http://ros-staging.herokuapp.com/
        banner_image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/calblueprint-prod/images/rootsofsuccess.png
        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Roots of Success strives to connect youth and adults from communities with
          high rates of poverty and unemployment to environmental careers and post-
          secondary education. With Roots of Success gaining more traction, it
          needed a way to efficiently manage more communities, teachers and
          students.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with Roots of Success to create a platform that
          allows teachers to gracefully manage multiple classrooms, modules and
          surveys.
