      headline: Technology for Nonprofits
      subtitle: We are a group of UC Berkeley students who want to use technology to improve our community.
      what_we_do: >
        Hey! We're Blueprint, a student organization using technology for social good.
        We build web and mobile applications for nonprofits pro bono and foster the use of technology
        for public welfare through events and discussions.
      our_projects: >
        Each year, teams of five students work with non-profit organizations on projects
        to help them better serve their communities. We've built a crowdfunding application for
        Berkeley's public schools, a professional development platform for digital literacy in Oakland, and
        much more.

          description: >
            Our projects are carefully constructed from the first contact with the nonprofit to project
            deployment and use in production. We are meticulous about our design, our process, and our code.
        culture:
          description: >
            Bluepers work hard and play hard. When weâ€™re not developing, we eat, play,
            and volunteer with each other. We think that life is best enjoyed with laughter,
            fun, and a sound foundation of friends.
        heart:
          description: We believe that our abilities should be used for good. Our motivation pushes us to constantly learn, work hard, and find solutions where others have not looked.
