“Ever wonder how technology can be used to promote social good? We do too.”

Build technology that improves the world. Blueprint pairs motivated teams with local nonprofits to create solutions for social good, pro bono.

We are UC Berkeley students who care about using technology to better our communities.

A crowdfunding application for teachers. A mobile app to reduce food waste. An accelerator for entrepreneurs in Africa. Our projects make an impact. (Read More)

Each semester, our talented developers and designers develop web and mobile applications with local nonprofits using industry-standard tools and methodology.

Projects
-------
We’ve worked with nonprofits from sectors ranging from education to energy, literacy to charity. For each project, we emphasize impact on the organization, team growth, clean design, and well-written code.

Example of project card:

**Berkeley Public Schools Fund** <br>
We worked closely with the Berkeley Public Schools Fund, which manages the grant distribution for teachers of the Berkeley Unified Schools District, to create a crowdfunding application for teacher projects.

About
-----
We care deeply about our communities, the clients we work with, and our teammates.

Craft: Our projects are carefully constructed from the first contact with the nonprofit to project deployment and use in production. We are meticulous about our design, our process, and our code.

Culture: Bluepers work hard and play hard. When we’re not developing, we eat together, play sports together, and volunteer together. We think that life is best enjoyed with laughter, fun, and a sound foundation of friends.

Heart: We believe that our abilities should be used for good. Our motivation pushes us to constantly learn, work hard, and find solutions where others have not looked.

Each member of our team brings his or her unique skills and experiences to the table to make each project as successful as it can be. Blueprint is made up of innovative designers, diligent hackers, and thoughtful leaders. We know that the individual might be talented but only a team has the power to take on the challenges we face as an organization.

Our Experience / Who We Are
-----------
Page (private page? this could seem a little snooty) for contacting corporate sponsors/potential infosession people that shows the places that people in Blueprint have worked at. Would make our club seem more “legit” to these sponsors, increasing chances of sponsorship and people wanting to partner with us to work with us and get our resume book
